Mix in egg and vanilla extract and mix on medium speed until combined.\n\nMix in baking soda and salt, then slowly mix in flour and mix just until the batter is smooth and comes together. Be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl during mixing. Slowly mix in chocolate chips.\n\nLine a cookie sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Scoop 2 tablespoon balls of dough onto the cookie sheet. Spacing doesn\u2019t matter because you will be chilling the dough.

Line a second cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.\n\nRemove the chilled cookie dough balls from the refrigerator and space them 2-inches apart on the cookie sheets.
